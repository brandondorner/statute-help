# Statute Help

An app designed to make legal documents more readable.


Instead of having to parse through statutes for sentences that meet certain criteria, a user can now interact with
inputs unique to the statute and be presented the correct sentence.


## Backend

Run `bundle exec rails s`

## Frontend

Run `npx vite --port=4000`
